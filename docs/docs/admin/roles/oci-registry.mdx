# OCI Registries

If you are serving an OCI registry behind Anubis, you will need to import the `(data)/clients/docker-client.yaml` file in order to make sure that OCI registry clients can download images:

```yaml
bots:
  - import: (data)/meta/default-config.yaml
  - import: (data)/clients/docker-client.yaml
# ... the rest of your config
```
